# Flyfighter-1
Pygame project for CPSC-386 at CSUF in 2024


## Special features
 - **2d Open World**:
   I designed 16 square shaped tiles which are randomly put together by the game. Each tile has either 0,1 or 2 entrances per side and an algorithm fiugres out how to place the tiles so    that they create a randomly yet coherent map with smooth transitions between tiles

# Flyfighter-1
Pygame project for CPSC-386 at CSUF in 2024.

## How to play:
- *Control* the player using arrow keys for movement and the spacebar to shoot.
- Move through the world and discover as many tiles as possible. Every tile entered increases your *score* by 1.
- With an increasing score, *difficulty* will increase (increasing opponent spawn probability and opponent shooting frequency)
- Make sure to collect enough *powerups* to be able to keep up with your opponents. 
- You will encounter 3 types of *opponents*: An easy opponent that just shoots you, a moving opponent who shoots and chases you, a tanky opponent who shoots you and has extra heartpoints.
- At one point in the game all your stats will be maxed out and only your skills will help you to achieve a higher score. Have fun and try to beat my high score!


## Special feature(s)
 - **2d Open World**:
   I designed 16 square shaped tiles which are randomly put together by the game. Each tile has either 0,1 or 2 entrances per side and an algorithm fiugres out how to place the tiles so    that they create a randomly yet coherent map with smooth transitions between tiles
